\# Who Am I 




Hello! My name is Guevna \*\*\*(Give-Na)\*\*\*, but I prefer to go by Nina. I am currently (2026) a Masters student at Northeastern University studying Bioinformatics. I did my undergraduate at Florida Atlantic University, and received my Bachelors in Biology in 2024.



My interest include precisions medicine, -omics, and Machine Learning. 

In the future I would love to contribute to work that integrates these fields to develop innovative therapies for patients in need.

When I am not studying or working, I love to play the guitar and the piano, cosplay, go on walks, and do arts and crafts on my free time.

I’m always eager to learn and explore new opportunities in the world of genetics and technology.
